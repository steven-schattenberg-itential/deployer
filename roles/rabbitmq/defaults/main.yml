# Makes it possible to override the total amount of memory available, as opposed to
# inferring it from the environment using OS-specific means. This should only be used
# when actual maximum amount of RAM available to the node doesn't match the value
# that will be inferred by the node, e.g. due to containerization or similar
# constraints the node cannot be aware of. The value may be set to an integer number
# of bytes or, alternatively, in information units (e.g `8GB`). For example, when the
# value is set to 4 GB, the node will believe it is running on a machine with 4 GB of RAM.
# Default: undefined (not set or used).
